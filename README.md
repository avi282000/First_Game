# First_Game
You'll have to download all the files  and put them in a single folder, in order for this to work!
First of all, you'll need to install the pygame module using the cmd or BASH (depends on what you're using)
Navigate to the folder you have saved the files in, using the the cmd/BASH.
Then, type in:          pip install some-package.whl
The package for the pygame module must have been installed 
Now, Just run the game now!  :)
